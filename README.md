# Legal Document Search with Cohere and Qdrant
This is a project built for the Multilingual Semantic Search Hackathon by LabLab.ai.

# Description
The goal of this project is to build a legal document search system that utilizes the Cohere and Qdrant APIs. The system will allow users to search for legal documents based on specific keywords or phrases, and retrieve relevant documents that can be relied upon in court.

# Technologies Used
The project will be built using Python, and will utilize the Cohere and Qdrant APIs for natural language processing and search functionality.

#Setup
To run the project, you will need to have Python installed on your computer, as well as the necessary libraries and dependencies. You will also need to obtain API keys for Cohere and Qdrant.

Once you have all the necessary components, you can clone the repository and run the application from the command line.

#Usage
To use the legal document search system, simply enter your desired search query and hit enter. The system will retrieve relevant documents and display them in a user-friendly format.
